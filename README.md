# Asteriods-Fury
Survive the Asteroid Field in Asteroids Fury!


Inspiration
The inspiration for Asteroids Fury came from the classic arcade game "Asteroids" which was released in 1979. The game was popular during its time and has since been a source of inspiration for many game developers. 

What it does
Asteroids Fury is an arcade-style game where players control a spaceship and must survive through an asteroid field while shooting down incoming asteroids and enemy spacecraft. The player must also avoid colliding with the asteroids and enemy ships that appear throughout the game. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through the levels, with faster and more frequent asteroids and enemy ships.

How we built it
To build Asteroids Fury, we used Python and the Pygame library. We followed standard game development practices, such as separating the game logic and user interface into different modules and classes.

Challenges we ran into
We also had to balance the difficulty level of the game to ensure that it was challenging enough to be engaging, but not too difficult to be frustrating.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the overall gameplay experience that we were able to create. We were also able to implement various gameplay mechanics, such as power-ups and different enemy types, to keep the game interesting.

What we learned
Through building Asteroids Fury, we learned a lot about game development and programming in general. We also learned how to work as a team and collaborate on a project.

What's next for Asteroids Fury
In the future, we plan to add more features to Asteroids Fury, such as a multiplayer mode and additional levels with different backgrounds and enemy types. We also plan to release the game on various platforms, such as mobile and desktop, to reach a wider audience.
